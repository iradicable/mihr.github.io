# Elishny

One of the few major settlements this far north, the inhabitants are struck by harsh winters. The streets connect the upper settlements to the undercity, offering comfort for both surface-dwellers and those more inclined to life away from sunlight. 

Many of the newcomers are tempted to travel in because of the headquarters of Iron Syndicate, the largest adventuring guild on all of Mihr. 

The current leader of the city and surrounding areas is a just and respected governor, second of his bloodline to be elected for the position.
