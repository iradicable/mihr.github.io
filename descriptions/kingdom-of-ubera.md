# Kingdom of Ubera

A kingdom named after the continent with the goal of uniting all its people. 

It has expanded over the years largely peacefully, depending on who sat at the throne at the time. A revolution took down the most despised of these rulers, and a member of a philanthropic lesser house took the throne with the support of the people.
