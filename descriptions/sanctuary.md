# Sanctuary

A floating mageocratic city state lifted into the skies by magics now forgotten. Those responsible of the feat had their very souls sundered as their spell drew fuel from where it could, and much of the knowledge was lost with them. 

A glimmering, multi-coloured spectacle dotted with arcane lights and carefully constructed towers, each taller and more opulent than the last. 

Home to the Eminescu Academy, the largest arcane school on the face of the planet named after a much respected mage and scholar.
