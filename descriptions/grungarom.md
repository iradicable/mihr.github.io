A subterranean city state built below The Watchers, the mountain range marking the very northern edge of Aeretis. 

While some residences are built outside on the faces of mountains, the large majority exists deep within the rock. Built in districts divided by tiers, the city sinks ever lower into the earth, requiring transportation technology in addition to streets, tunnels and walkways. 

Ruled by a king in name, the head of the state is in fact democratically chosen and supported by a council. Much like the rest of the populace the ruler is of dwarven blood, although many other deep-dwellers also inhabit the city. A wave of gnomish refugees was taken in when a series of unfortunate accidents took down Mount Rustsprocket, and with them came a new generation of technological advancement.
