# Tvelsk

The seat of the empress, and the capital and largest city of her lands. A marvelous construction of pale stone and tree habited by a diverse populace, although with a largely elven upper class. 

The city's wealth is plain to see, but the rigid hierarchies and carefully upheld laws leave a marked gap between the lifestyles of the nobility and common folk. Still, the life of the everyday person has improved in the three centuries since the continent-wide war, as the current empress is gentler than her parents whose fall ended the conflict.
