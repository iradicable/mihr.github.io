# Sedulga Empire

By far the largest nation on Mihr, the empire spreads across much of Aeretis and even some territories overseas. 

Upon the throne sits empress Valya Sedulga, the descendant of many generations of rulers. She is well liked in comparison to her more war-minded parents, and though she has no intention of surrendering places already under the empire’s banner, the empress does not seem to plan on further expansion either. 

While the southeastern-most areas as well as major cities and borders shared with other countries are well guarded by imperial forces, much of the rest is left to govern itself. Taxes are collected yearly, but beyond that burden most citizens are free of the worst of the empire’s oppression.
