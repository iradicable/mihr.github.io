# G2

A capitalist nation built with clear intent; the name simply stands for Goblin 2 as it was indeed established by a handful of determined goblinoids. 

Its predecessor—Goblin1—was a tremendous failure, but instead of a deterrent it was seen as a lesson for future success. Consisting of five cities named C1, C2, C3, C4 and C5, the establishments follow the expected naming convention with the C standing for “City”.
