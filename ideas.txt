things to maybe add or change / ask james if it's possible :^)

- toggling names instead of choosing one type at a time
- font borders
- dot marker on the side instead of above text where needed
    - possible to change the dots to a custom shape, like crowns for capitals or something
          - i guess i could do that by with alt codes or wingdings stars instead, but at least the latter would need a font change and i guess so would 
            the former, since simply copied alt code characters show up as ?s instead. looking at the character map the specific font used doesn't have 
            characters for anything fitting
- adding and/or changing size of segments (tiles?), alternatively/in addition better wrapping
- clicking on certain place names opens a map of said place on the side, although that'd take a lot of drawing so huge maybe
    - additionally/alternatively some info, could be a kanka link but that obviously only works for people with wiki invites
- ✅ click on globe for coordinates
- positioning of globe & text box
    - ideally maybe globe a bit to the left instead of center of the screen with toggles on the left and info on the right, whatever is doable
- clicking on globe makes box disappear
- it seems you gotta click on the dot instead of the text to toggle info boxes, like if you wanna select a continent especially you gotta click a good bit above the text
